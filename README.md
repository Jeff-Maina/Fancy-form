# fancy-form

Just a fancy sign-up form to practice css,html and javascript some concepts.

<b>Note</b>
- No verification is done (passwords do not have to be the same and the inputs do not have to be filled for one to proceed to the next input)
- One has to start typing for the submit icon to appear.
